The provided notebook and .yml environment file will allow you to recreate the results of Boehm et al. 2025 or modify our process to test adjacent ideas.

We do NOT provide the VALD files necessary to recreate the cross-sections from scratch; you can use the pre-computed ones provided in the .npy file on the corresponding Zenodo repository, or you can sign up for VALD, download cross-section files, and supply them customly.

We also do not provide the GJ 367 A spectrum file on GitHub due to size constraints; this file is available on Zenodo as well.
