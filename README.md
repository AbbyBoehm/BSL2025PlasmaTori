The provided notebook and .npy cross-section files will allow you to recreate the results of Boehm et al. 2025 or modify our process to test adjacent ideas.
A .yml file is also included to provide you with the needed environment.
We do NOT provide the VALD files necessary to recreate the cross-sections from scratch; you can use the pre-computed ones provided in the .npy file,
or you can sign up for VALD, download cross-section files, and supply them customly.
